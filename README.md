# Autonomous Stair-Climbing Rover | Industry 4.0 Lab

## Overview
This project focuses on the design, engineering, and virtual validation of an **autonomous rover capable of climbing stairs up to 10 cm in height**. Developed as part of the **Industry 4.0 Lab (Intelligent Manufacturing)** at Technische Universität Clausthal, the work emphasizes **system-level design, manufacturability, and autonomous operation** in indoor environments.

The rover integrates **mechanical design, sensor-based perception, and control logic**, validated through **CAD modeling and virtual testing** to assess feasibility before physical implementation.
